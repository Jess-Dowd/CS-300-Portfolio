# CS 300 Project Reflection

## 1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the projects for this course, the problem I was solving was designing a program to assist academic advisors at ABCU. The program needed to manage and display course information, such as course titles and prerequisites, in an alphanumeric order. It required using different data structures to organize and retrieve course data. In Project One, I focused on analyzing the runtime and memory usage of these data structures, while Project Two involved implementing code to load, sort, and display the course list.

## 2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by understanding the requirements of the project and figuring out which data structure would be best for the task. Data structures are important because they affect the efficiency of operations like searching, sorting, and inserting data. For example, a vector is simple to use but has slower search times, and a hash table has fast lookups but doesnâ€™t maintain order. After comparing the pros and cons of each data structure, I recommended using a binary search tree because it can maintain order while having efficient search operations.

## 3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
In the project, I encountered some challenges, especially with handling user input and file loading. At first, I faced issues with invalid inputs causing infinite loops. I overcame this by adding proper input validation and clearing the input stream whenever invalid data was detected. Also, I learned to handle file names with spaces and make sure the program handled errors like missing files more gracefully. Debugging and testing helped me refine the program.

## 4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has expanded my approach to software design by highlighting the importance of picking the right data structure for the task. I learned that choosing the most efficient data structure can affect the performance, especially in programs that have frequent lookups or sorting. I also got a better understanding of how to structure a program to handle errors and ensure a smoother user experience.

## 5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project has helped me focus more on writing maintainable and readable code. I made sure to add comments to explain the functionality of each part of the program and chose meaningful variable and function names to make the code easier to understand. It also reinforced the importance of modular design. By breaking the program into smaller functions, it becomes easier to maintain and adapt in the future.
